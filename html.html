        Colonel Birger Kristian Eriksen was an Norwegian officer, best known as the 
        commanding officer for the soldiers that sank the German warship Blücher on its
        way to Oslo 9.April 1940. This is his story:

        <h4>9.April 1940, The night Eriksen changed the Norwegian history</h4>
        <p>
            Up until this date, the Norwegian government had been extremly naive as Norway was 
            "neutral and had nothing to do with the European warfare." Even
            after reports of a large fleet of warships heading north from Germany, the
            government gave no order to prepare the fortresses for an attack. Eriksen however
            understood that this was a large scale invasion of Norway and gave his orders to
            prepare all cannons and torpedo batteries.<br>
            Sure enough, at 04:21 that night a large convoy off darkend ships passed Oscarsborg,
            heading for Oslo.Eriksen defied all his orders to only shoot warning shoots and fired
            directly at the first ship, an unexpected move for the Germans that exspected no
            resistance. The shoots sank Blücher and forced the rest off the convoy to rescue
            surviviors and go ashore to take the Oscarborg with infatery. They also launched 
            a massive bombing raid against the fortress. Two hours later 850 troops where ashore
            and Eriksen surrenderd his fortress later that day.<br>
            The important part off these actions is that the German timetable got delayed by
            almost 24 hours, giving the government and the king time to escape from Oslo, and
            later to England where they lead the resistance. It also gave the bank time to
            evacuate all the gold reserves to a safe location, hiding it from the Germans.

        <p>
            After the war, people that had made considerable efforts during the war got awarded.
            Eriksen was among them and recieved the higest decoration an offiser could get.
            "Krigskorset med sverd", directly translated to "War crusade with sword" He also
            got the French award "Croix de Guerre" and became an officer of the "French Honorary legion"
            <br>
            He`s also rememberd for these short and non-mistakable quotes:

        <h2 class="text-center quoteFont">
            "Warhero or warcriminal, fire!"<br><br>
